                <p>Front-end developer - ENTP, bootcamp graduate current in full stack JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Node.js, React, database best practices, hosting providers. Now seeking to leverage sales & marketing experience in IT management for Fortune 100 in a mid-size department or company. Also skilled in UX matters, I can help the business with strategic thinking, organize brainstorming sessions, work closely with designers, and oversee vendors. </p>

                <p>Trained and re-certified in the latest tools and technologies in front-end design, full stack Javascript, and UX methodologies, I am technically proficient in the latest web technologies, graphic/interface design, and design thinking currently seeking an opportunity to apply this know-how in the professional environment of a small or medium size private company or in the public sector.</p>

                <p>I am considered a creative, hard working, disciplined, and a people oriented individual.  Formally trained in graphic and digital arts at the Cooper Union school in NYC, the Beaux Arts in Paris, and The University of the Arts in Philadelphia, I strive to excel and improve my work each and every day. My background also includes extensive travel experiences with first-hand exposure to diverse cultures; this can be helpful in collaboration with diverse people or in devising new design models.</p>

                <p>As a positive value add-on, I am acquainted with some aspects of business management having served sales and marketing management for a large corporation and taken business classes at Lehigh.</p>

                <p>In SCRUM meetings, a standard question is what is your superpower? Even though I don't believe that superheroes exist, I think software creates a system that allows many minds working together in tandem to succeed together. System design is thus more than the usability of the user-interface or the efficiently of the software. Once upon a time a technology manager at Pfizer Inc desiging a new SFA system. During the discovery phase, I was able to sift through heaps of information gathered first-hand in the USA across the field and I helped consolidate a marketing distribution system in a large multiplex organization with many disparate working sales practices. Thus, I learned to serve the organization as a connector and a motivator between many cross-functional departments, to champion ideas, mandate and enforce priorities that improve software quality, and most importantly communicate requirements to executives and technical teams. These traits improve implementation of desired outcomes â€” I am therefore, results-oriented; all of which have contributed to Pfizer's excellent drug sales.</p>
